# Event-Calendar-

This project was made for a college course and therefore somethings are formatted a certain way due to constraints given to me by my 
teacher.

This is a simple GUI that allows you to input events which are made up of an event name, event venue, event date, the numbers of tickets
sold to the event, the ticket price, and the overhead costs. When you create an event after inputting all of the information you get a
list of everything printed out along with how much profit is made from the event and how many tickets you would need to break even for the
event. After inputting a few events you can sort the list by date or name. You can also change the amount of tickets sold to an event by
inputting its name into the name box and then putting in the new amount of tickets sold. Lastly you can export the whole list to a .csv
file called events.


Please don't use my work to complete the same project as I don't want to be responsible for making sure people arent cheating.
